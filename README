Run "make" to create h5mdplugin.so
This shared object can than be loaded by VMD.

For example you may include the path to the .so file in your .vmdrc with the following command:
		vmd_plugin_scandirectory /PATH_TO_SO_DIRECTORY/ *.so

Another way to load the plugin is to move the .so file into the plugin folder of VMD
