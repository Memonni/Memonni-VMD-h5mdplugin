To compile the plugin, adapt the Makefile and run "make". This should work on
any Unix that has VMD and HDF5 installed. For example under Ubuntu you need the
package libhdf5-dev and the VMD sources.

Alternatively, you may build the plugin with CMake, which requires the
environment variable VMDDIR to be set.

To load the plugin in VMD add the following line to your ~/.vmdrc (replace the
directory to where you have compiled it):

        vmd_plugin_scandirectory /PATH_TO_SO_DIRECTORY/ h5mdplugin.so

Remark 1: the plugin only works with threedimensional position datasets.
Remark 2: the files libh5md.c and libh5md.h provide common C routines to read and write H5MD files. The library is licensed under GPLv3.
