To compile the plugin, adapt the Makefile and run "make". This should work on any Unix that has VMD and HDF5 installed.

To load the plugin in VMD add the following line to your ~/.vmdrc (replace the directory to where you have compiled it):

        vmd_plugin_scandirectory /PATH_TO_SO_DIRECTORY/ *.so

(Another way to load the plugin is to move the .so file into the plugin folder of VMD)
